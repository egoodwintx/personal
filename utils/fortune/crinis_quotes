“This life is what you make it. No matter what, you're going to mess up sometimes, it's a universal truth. But the good part is you get to decide how you're going to mess it up. Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.” ― Marilyn Monroe

If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell: a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people, and implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous.

The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people.

"I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.”     ―        Richard P. Feynman,               The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: The Best Short Works of Richard P.

From his ruminations on science in our culture to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, this book will fascinate anyone interested in the world of ideas.\n\nEl placer de descubrir permite acceder al mundo personal, social y cientíco de Richard Feynman, por ejemplo, a sus aventuras mientras participó en el Proyecto Manhattan, cuando se divertía —y escandalizaba— descifrando las claves de cajas fuertes, o a cómo se inició, siendo un niño, en el estudio de la naturaleza (en el «placer de descubrir»), que terminaría ocupando toda su vida. Podemos, asimismo, conocer sus pioneras ideas sobre las computadoras del futuro, su opinión acerca del valor de la ciencia o la explicación, tan sencilla como profunda, que dio al desastre de la lanzadera espacial Challenger.

"Beware the irrational, however seductive. Shun the 'transcendent' and all who invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself. Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others. Don't be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. Picture all experts as if they were mammals. Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty of time for silence. Suspect your own motives, and all excuses. Do not live for others any more than you would expect others to live for you.”     ―        Christopher Hitchens,               Letters to a Young Contrarian              //<![CDATA[       var newTip = new Tip($('quote_book_link_503150'), ""\n\n  <h2><a class=\""readable bookTitle\"" href=\""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503150.Letters_to_a_Young_Contrarian?from_choice=false&amp;from_home_module=false\"">Letters to a Young Contrarian<\/a><\/h2>\n\n      <div>\n        by <a class=\""authorName\"" href=\""/author/show/3956.Christopher_Hitchens\"">Christopher Hitchens<\/a>\n      <\/div>\n\n          <div class=\""smallText uitext darkGreyText\"">\n            <span class=\""minirating\""><span class=\""stars staticStars notranslate\""><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p3\""><\/span><\/span> 4.14 avg rating &mdash; 11,435 ratings<\/span>            &mdash; published 2001\n          <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\""addBookTipDescription\"">\n      \n<span id=\""freeTextContainer3988817677951165384\"">From bestselling author and provocateur Christopher Hitchens, the classic guide to the art of principled dissent and disagreement\n\nIn Letters to a Young Contrarian, bestselling author and world-class provocateur Christopher Hitchens inspires the radi<\/span>\n  <span id=\""freeText3988817677951165384\"" style=\""display:none\"">From bestselling author and provocateur Christopher Hitchens, the classic guide to the art of principled dissent and disagreement\n\nIn Letters to a Young Contrarian, bestselling author and world-class provocateur Christopher Hitchens inspires the radicals, gadflies, mavericks, rebels, and angry young (wo)men of tomorrow. Exploring the entire range of &quot;contrary positions&quot;—from noble dissident to gratuitous nag—Hitchens introduces the next generation to the minds and the misfits who influenced him, invoking such mentors as Emile Zola, Rosa Parks, and George Orwell. As is his trademark, Hitchens pointedly pitches himself in contrast to stagnant attitudes across the ideological spectrum. No other writer has matched Hitchens\'s understanding of the importance of disagreement—to personal integrity, to informed discussion, to true progress, to democracy itself.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\""3988817677951165384\"" href=\""#\"" onclick=\""swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\"">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'9_book_503150\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\""/shelf/add_to_shelf\"" accept-charset=\""UTF-8\"" method=\""post\""><input name=\""utf8\"" type=\""hidden\"" value=\""&#x2713;\"" /><input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""authenticity_token\"" value=\""im4lG45iaXXPTYoZqH6Ug+Y+DJeiu2WpWSl7wG2HaEWB61cxABA1q+8JaJchJYW4xr9EU20jeYwDCsSMV1OMHA==\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""book_id\"" id=\""book_id\"" value=\""503150\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""name\"" id=\""name\"" value=\""to-read\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""unique_id\"" id=\""unique_id\"" value=\""9_book_503150\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""wtr_new\"" id=\""wtr_new\"" value=\""true\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_choice\"" id=\""from_choice\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_home_module\"" id=\""from_home_module\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""ref\"" id=\""ref\"" value=\""\"" class=\""wtrLeftUpRef\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""existing_review\"" id=\""existing_review\"" value=\""false\"" class=\""wtrExisting\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_referrer\"" id=\""page_referrer\"" value=\""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_url\"" id=\""page_url\"" value=\""/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\""hiddenShelfForm\"" action=\""/shelf/add_to_shelf\"" accept-charset=\""UTF-8\"" method=\""post\""><input name=\""utf8\"" type=\""hidden\"" value=\""&#x2713;\"" /><input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""authenticity_token\"" value=\""GUdYL/LXhEMUTL6gQ69YguuapbNFb631jqDnkTjQuggSwioFfKXYnTQIXC7K9Em5yxvtd4r3sdDUg1jdAgReUQ==\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""unique_id\"" id=\""unique_id\"" value=\""9_book_503150\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""book_id\"" id=\""book_id\"" value=\""503150\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""a\"" id=\""a\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""name\"" id=\""name\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_choice\"" id=\""from_choice\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_home_module\"" id=\""from_home_module\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_referrer\"" id=\""page_referrer\"" value=\""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_url\"" id=\""page_url\"" value=\""/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

"Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light‐years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the presence of great art or music or literature, or acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.”     ―        Carl Sagan,               The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark              //<![CDATA[       var newTip = new Tip($('quote_book_link_17349'), ""\n\n  <h2><a class=\""readable bookTitle\"" href=\""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17349.The_Demon_Haunted_World?from_choice=false&amp;from_home_module=false\"">The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark<\/a><\/h2>\n\n      <div>\n        by <a class=\""authorName\"" href=\""/author/show/10538.Carl_Sagan\"">Carl Sagan<\/a>\n      <\/div>\n\n          <div class=\""smallText uitext darkGreyText\"">\n            <span class=\""minirating\""><span class=\""stars staticStars notranslate\""><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p3\""><\/span><\/span> 4.28 avg rating &mdash; 68,806 ratings<\/span>            &mdash; published 1996\n          <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\""addBookTipDescription\"">\n      \n<span id=\""freeTextContainer13243580744030411441\"">How can we make intelligent decisions about our increasingly technology-driven lives if we don’t understand the difference between the myths of pseudoscience and the testable hypotheses of science?

Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.\n\nCasting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today\'s so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\""13243580744030411441\"" href=\""#\"" onclick=\""swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\"">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'12_book_17349\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\""/shelf/add_to_shelf\"" accept-charset=\""UTF-8\"" method=\""post\""><input name=\""utf8\"" type=\""hidden\"" value=\""&#x2713;\"" /><input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""authenticity_token\"" value=\""S91C0K94eD3fRTMfHeDtBiC8holygw2TIlS6M2vOIT9AWDD6IQok4/8B0ZGUu/w9AD3OTb0bEbZ4dwV/URrFZg==\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""book_id\"" id=\""book_id\"" value=\""17349\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""name\"" id=\""name\"" value=\""to-read\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""unique_id\"" id=\""unique_id\"" value=\""12_book_17349\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""wtr_new\"" id=\""wtr_new\"" value=\""true\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_choice\"" id=\""from_choice\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_home_module\"" id=\""from_home_module\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""ref\"" id=\""ref\"" value=\""\"" class=\""wtrLeftUpRef\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""existing_review\"" id=\""existing_review\"" value=\""false\"" class=\""wtrExisting\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_referrer\"" id=\""page_referrer\"" value=\""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_url\"" id=\""page_url\"" value=\""/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\""hiddenShelfForm\"" action=\""/shelf/add_to_shelf\"" accept-charset=\""UTF-8\"" method=\""post\""><input name=\""utf8\"" type=\""hidden\"" value=\""&#x2713;\"" /><input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""authenticity_token\"" value=\""pb2sXuY8gY2U/f8rJ1hyMk2CnKAjnZV2Ds/mKa+ISr2uON50aE7dU7S5HaWuA2MJbQPUZOwFiVNU7FlllVyu5A==\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""unique_id\"" id=\""unique_id\"" value=\""12_book_17349\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""book_id\"" id=\""book_id\"" value=\""17349\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""a\"" id=\""a\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""name\"" id=\""name\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_choice\"" id=\""from_choice\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_home_module\"" id=\""from_home_module\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_referrer\"" id=\""page_referrer\"" value=\""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_url\"" id=\""page_url\"" value=\""/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

“The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own meaning, they generate their own motivation. For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You'd be surprised how far that gets you.”     ―        Neil deGrasse Tyson

"I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow, it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally, I am an atheist.

“Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, the atoms in your left hand probably came from a different star than your right hand. It really is the most poetic thing I know about physics: You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements - the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life - weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be here today.”     ―        Lawrence M. Krauss

“Whether or not you believe in God, you must believe this: when we as a species abandon our trust in a power greater than us, we abandon our sense of accountability. Faiths… all faiths… are admonitions that there is something we cannot understand, something to which we are accountable. With faith we are accountable to each other, to ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. The church consists of a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion in a world spinning out of control.”     ―        Dan Brown,               Angels & Demons              //<![CDATA[       var newTip = new Tip($('quote_book_link_960'), ""\n\n  <h2><a class=\""readable bookTitle\"" href=\""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/960.Angels_Demons?from_choice=false&amp;from_home_module=false\"">Angels &amp; Demons (Robert Langdon, #1)<\/a><\/h2>\n\n      <div>\n        by <a class=\""authorName\"" href=\""/author/show/630.Dan_Brown\"">Dan Brown<\/a><span title=\""Goodreads Author!\"">*<\/span>\n      <\/div>\n\n          <div class=\""smallText uitext darkGreyText\"">\n            <span class=\""minirating\""><span class=\""stars staticStars notranslate\""><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p6\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p0\""><\/span><\/span> 3.93 avg rating &mdash; 3,025,817 ratings<\/span>            &mdash; published 2000\n          <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\""addBookTipDescription\"">\n      \n<span id=\""freeTextContainer3600248556044962552\"">World-renowned Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to a Swiss research facility to analyze a cryptic symbol seared into the chest of a murdered physicist.

“You will be required to do wrong no matter where you go. It is the basic condition of life, to be required to violate your own identity. At some time, every creature which lives must do so. It is the ultimate shadow, the defeat of creation; this is the curse at work, the curse that feeds on all life. Everywhere in the universe.”     ―        Philip K. Dick

“Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe? The usual approach of science of constructing a mathematical model cannot answer the questions of why there should be a universe for the model to describe.

That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking\'s theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe\'s beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\""6871114096823103827\"" href=\""#\"" onclick=\""swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\"">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'4_book_3869\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\""/shelf/add_to_shelf\"" accept-charset=\""UTF-8\"" method=\""post\""><input name=\""utf8\"" type=\""hidden\"" value=\""&#x2713;\"" /><input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""authenticity_token\"" value=\""pgHjFtgy7+OKwhLDbQjdjvETK7THjiEXN0BLeRjQVBSthJE8VkCzPaqG8E3kU8y10ZJjcAgWPTJtY/Q1IgSwTQ==\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""book_id\"" id=\""book_id\"" value=\""3869\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""name\"" id=\""name\"" value=\""to-read\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""unique_id\"" id=\""unique_id\"" value=\""4_book_3869\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""wtr_new\"" id=\""wtr_new\"" value=\""true\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_choice\"" id=\""from_choice\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_home_module\"" id=\""from_home_module\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""ref\"" id=\""ref\"" value=\""\"" class=\""wtrLeftUpRef\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""existing_review\"" id=\""existing_review\"" value=\""false\"" class=\""wtrExisting\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_referrer\"" id=\""page_referrer\"" value=\""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/science?page=2\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_url\"" id=\""page_url\"" value=\""/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\""hiddenShelfForm\"" action=\""/shelf/add_to_shelf\"" accept-charset=\""UTF-8\"" method=\""post\""><input name=\""utf8\"" type=\""hidden\"" value=\""&#x2713;\"" /><input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""authenticity_token\"" value=\""W7mHnwz0b9qRSX2VVSDSJDPHh+4MGAUnl6NNV6Gm9QJQPPW1goYzBLENnxvce8MfE0bPKsOAGQLNgPIbm3IRWw==\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""unique_id\"" id=\""unique_id\"" value=\""4_book_3869\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""book_id\"" id=\""book_id\"" value=\""3869\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""a\"" id=\""a\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""name\"" id=\""name\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_choice\"" id=\""from_choice\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_home_module\"" id=\""from_home_module\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_referrer\"" id=\""page_referrer\"" value=\""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/science?page=2\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_url\"" id=\""page_url\"" value=\""/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. Kahneman exposes the extraordinary capabilities—and also the faults and biases—of fast thinking, and reveals the pervasive influence of intuitive impressions on our thoughts and behavior. The impact of loss aversion and overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the challenges of properly framing risks at work and at home, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning the next vacation—each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems work together to shape our judgments and decisions.\n\nEngaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking.

“From the standpoint of daily life, however, there is one thing we do know: that we are here for the sake of each other - above all for those upon whose smile and well-being our own happiness depends, and also for the countless unknown souls with whose fate we are connected by a bond of sympathy. Many times a day I realize how much my own outer and inner life is built upon the labors of my fellow men, both living and dead, and how earnestly I must exert myself in order to give in return as much as I have received.”     ―        Albert Einstein

This Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction by James Moore and Adrian Desmond.\n\nIn The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin refused to discuss human evolution, believing the subject too \'surrounded with prejudices\'. He had been reworking his notes since the 1830s, but only with trepidation did he finally publish The Descent of Man in 1871. The book notoriously put apes in our family tree and made the races one family, diversified by \'sexual selection\' - Darwin\'s provocative theory that female choice among competing males leads to diverging racial characteristics. Named by Sigmund Freud as \'one of the ten most significant books\' ever written, Darwin\'s Descent of Man continues to shape the way we think about what it is that makes us uniquely human.\n\nIn their introduction, James Moore and Adrian Desmond, acclaimed biographers of Charles Darwin, call for a radical re-assessment of the book, arguing that its core ideas on race were fired by Darwin\'s hatred of slavery. The text is the second and definitive edition and this volume also contains suggestions for further reading, a chronology and biographical sketches of prominent individuals mentioned.\n\nCharles Darwin (1809-82), a Victorian scientist and naturalist, has become one of the most famous figures of science to date. The advent of On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection in 1859 challenged and contradicted all contemporary biological and religious beliefs.\n\nIf you enjoyed The Descent of Man, you might like Darwin\'s On the Origin of Species, also available in Penguin Classics.<\/span>\n  <a data-text-id=\""16487389268013222209\"" href=\""#\"" onclick=\""swapContent(\$(this));; return false;\"">...more<\/a>\n\n    <\/div>\n\n      <div class=\'wtrButtonContainer wtrSignedOut\' id=\'7_book_185407\'>\n<div class=\'wtrUp wtrLeft\'>\n<form action=\""/shelf/add_to_shelf\"" accept-charset=\""UTF-8\"" method=\""post\""><input name=\""utf8\"" type=\""hidden\"" value=\""&#x2713;\"" /><input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""authenticity_token\"" value=\""FbKcc3aBHBJnwj7rtMulWnATbOa+NPc/QpTCQpXFJCUeN+5Z+PNAzEeG3GU9kLRhUJIkInGs6xoYt30OrxHAfA==\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""book_id\"" id=\""book_id\"" value=\""185407\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""name\"" id=\""name\"" value=\""to-read\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""unique_id\"" id=\""unique_id\"" value=\""7_book_185407\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""wtr_new\"" id=\""wtr_new\"" value=\""true\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_choice\"" id=\""from_choice\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_home_module\"" id=\""from_home_module\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""ref\"" id=\""ref\"" value=\""\"" class=\""wtrLeftUpRef\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""existing_review\"" id=\""existing_review\"" value=\""false\"" class=\""wtrExisting\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_referrer\"" id=\""page_referrer\"" value=\""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/science?page=2\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_url\"" id=\""page_url\"" value=\""/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<button class=\'wtrToRead\' type=\'submit\'>\n<span class=\'progressTrigger\'>Want to Read<\/span>\n<span class=\'progressIndicator\'>saving…<\/span>\n<\/button>\n<\/form>\n\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'wtrRight wtrUp\'>\n<form class=\""hiddenShelfForm\"" action=\""/shelf/add_to_shelf\"" accept-charset=\""UTF-8\"" method=\""post\""><input name=\""utf8\"" type=\""hidden\"" value=\""&#x2713;\"" /><input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""authenticity_token\"" value=\""g0WWPB1Cd8o9h4CNm3GU7G3croDQMX5ams88LfUXrLiIwOQWkzArFB3DYgMSKoXXTV3mRB+pYn/A7INhz8NI4Q==\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""unique_id\"" id=\""unique_id\"" value=\""7_book_185407\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""book_id\"" id=\""book_id\"" value=\""185407\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""a\"" id=\""a\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""name\"" id=\""name\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_choice\"" id=\""from_choice\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""from_home_module\"" id=\""from_home_module\"" value=\""false\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_referrer\"" id=\""page_referrer\"" value=\""https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/science?page=2\"" />\n<input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""page_url\"" id=\""page_url\"" value=\""/quotes/tag/science\"" />\n<\/form>\n\n<button class=\'wtrShelfButton\'><\/button>\n<\/div>\n\n<div class=\'ratingStars wtrRating\'>\n<div class=\'starsErrorTooltip hidden\'>\nError rating book.

“The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence.” ― Nikola Tesla

“I don't accept the currently fashionable assertion that any view is automatically as worthy of respect as any equal and opposite view. My view is that the moon is made of rock. If someone says to me 'Well, you haven't been there, have you? You haven't seen it for yourself, so my view that it is made of Norwegian Beaver Cheese is equally valid' - then I can't even be bothered to argue. There is such a thing as the burden of proof, and in the case of god, as in the case of the composition of the moon, this has shifted radically. God used to be the best explanation we'd got, and we've now got vastly better ones. God is no longer an explanation of anything, but has instead become something that would itself need an insurmountable amount of explaining. So I don't think that being convinced that there is no god is as irrational or arrogant a point of view as belief that there is. I don't think the matter calls for even-handedness at all.” ― Douglas Adams

Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible. Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking, and its greatest failures by not talking. It doesn't have to be like this. Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future. With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded. All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.”     ―        Stephen Hawking

"How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property – either as a child, a wife, or a concubine – must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.” ― Winston Churchill, The River War

"The so-called paradox of freedom is the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any constraining control must lead to very great restraint, since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek. The idea is, in a slightly different form, and with very different tendency, clearly expressed in Plato.Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.”     ―        Karl Raimund Popper,               The Open Society and Its Enemies              //<![CDATA[       var newTip = new Tip($('quote_book_link_240592'), ""\n\n  <h2><a class=\""readable bookTitle\"" href=\""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240592.The_Open_Society_and_Its_Enemies?from_choice=false&amp;from_home_module=false\"">The Open Society and Its Enemies<\/a><\/h2>\n\n      <div>\n        by <a class=\""authorName\"" href=\""/author/show/349707.Karl_Popper\"">Karl Popper<\/a>\n      <\/div>\n\n          <div class=\""smallText uitext darkGreyText\"">\n            <span class=\""minirating\""><span class=\""stars staticStars notranslate\""><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p10\""><\/span><span size=\""12x12\"" class=\""staticStar p3\""><\/span><\/span> 4.22 avg rating &mdash; 1,847 ratings<\/span>            &mdash; published 1956\n          <\/div>\n\n    <div class=\""addBookTipDescription\"">\n      \n<span id=\""freeTextContainer10799268755018617804\"">Written in political exile in New Zealand during the Second World War and published in two volumes in 1945, The Open Society and its Enemies was hailed by Bertrand Russell as a &apos;vigorous and profound defence of democracy&apos;.

This legendary attack on the philosophies of Plato, Hegel and Marx prophesied the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe and exposed the fatal flaws of socially engineered political systems. It remains highly readable, erudite and lucid and as essential reading today as on publication in 1945.

"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” ― Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species
